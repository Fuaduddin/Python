### 7.1.2. Count Number of Factor

**Solution: 1**
-------------

```python
def isPrime(x):                    # checks a number whether its prime or not
    i = 2
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
        i+=1
    return True

# main program starts from here

n = int(input("Take an Input: "))       # input() function takes input as string.
                                        # int() converts this string to integer type

prime = [i for i in range(2,n) if isPrime(i)==True]   # comprehension method. Discussed detailed in comment section

factor = []                           # Empty list declaration
tmp = n

for i in prime:                     # here 'i' refers to a single prime number in 'prime' list
    if n%i == 0:                    # if i is prime and n is divisible by i
        while n%i == 0:             # loop runs until n is divisible by i
            n/=i;                   # dividing n by i
            factor.append(i)        # inserting current prime factor in list

if n>1:
    factor.append(n)

print("Number of factors of %d is %d"%(tmp,len(factor)))    

```

    Take an Input: 40
    Number of factors of 40 is 4

### Comment

***Here len() is a function which returns total element of a list data type.
%tmp refers for only one %d, %(tmp,len(factor)) refers to two %d in print function.For N number of %d there will be %(V1,V2,.....VN) variables to specify those N number of %d.***

    i = 2
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0:

        i+=1
    return True


# main program starts from here

n = int(input("Take an Input: "))       # input() function takes input as string.
                                        # int() converts this string to integer type

prime = [i for i in range(2,n) if isPrime(i)==True]   # comprehension method. Discussed detailed in comment section

count,tmp = 0,n                   # simultaneous declaration count = 0 and tmp = n

for i in prime:                   # here 'i' refers to a single prime number in 'prime' list
    if n%i == 0:                  # if i is prime and n is divisible by i
        while n%i == 0:           # loop runs until n is divisible by i
            n/=i;                 # dividing n by i
            count+=1      

if n>1:
    count+=1

print("Number of factors of %d is %d"%(tmp,count))

```

    Take an Input: 40
    Number of factors of 40 is 4

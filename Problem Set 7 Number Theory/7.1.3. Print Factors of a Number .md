# 7.1. Factoring Number: (6)

### 7.1.3. Print Factors of a Number



**Solution: 1**

--------------------


```python
def isPrime(x):             # checks a number whether its prime or not
    i = 2
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
        i+=1
    return True


# main program starts from here

n = int(input("Take an Input: "))      # input() function takes input as string.
                                       # int() converts this string to integer type
factor = []                            # Empty list declaration
tmp = n

for i in range(2,n):                # looping from 2 to n
    if isPrime(i) and n%i == 0:     # if i is prime and n is divisible by i
        while n%i == 0:             # loop runs until n is divisible by i
            n/=i;                   # dividing n by i
            factor.append(i)        # inserting current prime factor in list

if n>1:
    factor.append(n)

print("Prime factors of %d: "%tmp,end='')
print(factor)




```

### Comment

***In function print("Prime factors of %d: "%tmp,end=''),  '%tmp' tends to put the value in 'tmp' in replace of '%d' portion of that function. end ='' is used to avoid any by default printing of newline from printf function***

**Solution: 2**

-------------------

```python
def isPrime(x):                    # checks a number whether its prime or not
    i = 2
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
        i+=1
    return True

# main program starts from here

n = int(input("Take an Input: "))       # input() function takes input as string.
                                        # int() converts this string to integer type

prime = [i for i in range(2,n) if isPrime(i)==True]   # comprehension method. Discussed detailed in comment section

factor = []                       # Empty list declaration
tmp = n

for i in prime:                   # here 'i' refers to a single prime number in 'prime' list
    if n%i == 0:                  # if i is prime and n is divisible by i
        while n%i == 0:           # loop runs until n is divisible by i
            n/=i;                 # dividing n by i
            factor.append(i)      # inserting current prime factor in list

if n>1:
    factor.append(n)

print("Prime factors of %d: "%tmp,end='')

for i in factor:
    print(i,end=',')
